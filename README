Mojo is a project to implement a cross platform Digital Audio Workstation.

Alternate names for this project include MyMojo and Alta

MyMojo because so far this project, when I get around to work on it
is only really done out of personal interest.

Alta because some of this code has been a response to code I've seen in
Ardour, hence Alt-A(rdour).

The platforms initially being targetted are Linux and Windows
