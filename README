Alta is a project to implement a cross platform Digital Audio Workstation.

Alta because some of this code has been a response to code I've seen in
Ardour, hence Alt-A(rdour). This project is a way for me to flesh out
some ideas before hopefully integrating them into Ardour or presenting
alternative designs to Ardour developers.

The differences between this project and Ardour is the scope and development
process. The intended scope being much smaller and development process being
more test driven.

Latin origin, and the meaning of Alta is "high, elevated", if that comes
across as arrogant and condescending that is not my intention, I just like
the name.

The platforms initially being targetted are Linux, Windows and OS X.
