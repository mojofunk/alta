  <title>Identifier Naming Conventions</title>
  <para>
    Member variable and member function identifiers are all lower case
    letters. An underscore is used for word separation.
  </para>

  <para>
    Member variables are prefixed by <literal>m_</literal>, so for instance
    <literal>name</literal> would become <literal>m_name</literal>.
  </para>

  <para>
    Static member variables are prefixed by <literal>sm_</literal>.
  </para>

  <para>
    This helps identify what the type of an variable is and it is less ugly
    than just prefixing with <literal>_</literal>.
  </para>

  <para>
    namespace identifiers should be as short as possible and lower case.
  </para>

  <para>
    Class names should use UpperCamelCase
  </para>
