    <title>Member Variable Names</title>
    <para>
      Member variable and member function identifiers are all lower case
      letters. An underscore is used for word separation.
    </para>

    <para>
      Member variables are prefixed by <literal>m_</literal>, so for
      instance <literal>name</literal> would become
      <literal>m_name</literal>.
    </para>

    <para>
      Static member variables are prefixed by <literal>sm_</literal>.
    </para>

    <para>
      This helps identify what the type of an variable is and it is less
      ugly than just prefixing with <literal>_</literal>.
