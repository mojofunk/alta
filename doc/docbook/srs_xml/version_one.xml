    tool for recording, editing and mixing of audio data.

    The eventual goal is to create an application that is similar in
    functionality to Steinberg's Cubase. The design and usability of the
    application will also be modelled on Cubase as it is a popular tool and
    the design has been refined over many versions. Once the application is
    complete enough to be useful then differenciation may occur.
