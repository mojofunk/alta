    <title>Commit size</title>
    <para>
      Each set of changes that is commited must be as small and distinct as
      possible. An indication that a commit is too large and should be split
      up is if it takes more than one sentence to describe what the change
      was.
    </para>

    <para>
      Reasons for a large commit might be a rename of a function or variable
      that effects a large number of source files but that in itself
      signifies that the code may need to be refactored
