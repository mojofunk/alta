  <section>
    <title>Time Based Releases</title>
    <para>
      The release cycle works around a rough 6 month timeline
    </para>

    <para>
      This time period was chosen because it corresponds to the release
      cycle length of Gnome and major linux distributions such as Fedora and
      Ubuntu.
    </para>

    <para>
      This should mean that each new release can get a greater amount of
      testing.
    </para>

    <para>
      There are two phases of a release, the development period and the
      testing period.
    </para>

    <para>
      All code committed during the development period must exist and be
      accessible for review before the development period starts.
    </para>

    <para>
      All code committed during the development period must be reviewed and
      approved by the lead developers before the period starts.
    </para>

    <para>
      New library dependencies can only be introduced during development
      period and must be approved by platform maintainers.
    </para>
