LIBMOJO

Make a generic module infrastructure for libmojo, modules may include

AudioFile modules:
	SndfileAudioFileModule
	MadAudioFileModule
	CoreaudioAudioFileModule

AudioEffectModule:
	LADSPAEffectModule
	LV2EffectModule
	VSTEffectModule
	DXEffectModule

InstrumentModule:
	VSTInstrumentModule
	DXInstrumentModule

AudioDriverModule:
	JACKAudioDriverModule
	ALSAAudioDriverModule
	PulseAudioDriverModule
	PortAudioDriverModule
	VSTAudioDriverModule

AudioResamplerModule:
	SRCResamplerModule
	SpeexResamplerModule

ProjectImportModule
	ArdourImportModule
	AAFImportModule

ProjectExportModule
	ArdourExportModule
	AAFExportModule

Try having only one instance of a Module class per module, change
the module function to mojo_module_init () that allocates Module
class(if init hasn't already been called) and returns a pointer to
it, also add a mojo_module_fini () function to deallocate any
resources allocated by init for proper shutdown.

libmojo must expose a way to discover new modules

modules should only have to link to a small core library if at all

Should all platform dependent code be in a base library
which modules can link to? possibly in libgleam

TESTS

Create a complex new project using all data types, save, close and restore.

SMPTE

smpte::time interface with implementations for each time type
vs
one class with enum for each type(4)

The later may be slightly slower due to branching.

conversion to/from ltc/vitc/mtc.

RT GRAPH

The graph must be directed and acyclic

graph processing must be able to support rt safe processing

There must be able to be more than one graph per process

A graph contains a number of nodes

The graph cannot have parallel edges between nodes?

Can a graph contain isolated nodes(no edges)?

A source node is a node with no incoming edges

A sink node is a node with no outgoing edges

A processing node is a node with incoming and outgoing edges

Must be able to add and remove edges.

The source nodes in the graph are processed first as they are
the source of the data and the edges are followed to process the
rest of the nodes.

The graph must be able to be processed in parallel.

Would breadth first processing be more cache friendly?

The API must expose a way to set how many threads are used to process
the graph.

get_max_thread_count

get_thread_count
set_thread_count

// optional
get_optimal_thread_count

The test suite must be able to measure total process time

The test suite must be able to measure thread context switching time.

The test suite must be able to test the effect cache size has on processing
performance.
