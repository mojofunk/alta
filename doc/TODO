for methods in gleam:: that create directories etc. add an argument to take a mode
and have it default to gleam::default_file_mode or whatever.

Change logx so it doesn't depend on glib. glib logging causes an extra set of
locking to take place. glib logging can't easily be made lock-free. There are
no real advantages to providing a glib logging backend that I can think of.

In mojo::user::paths don't create the directory when returning the search path.
don't return search path, just a string.

explore using boost::thread instead of glib/mm threads in libgleam or possibly
a compile time selection.

Break build system up so that testing for dependencies does not have to be done
each time.

Add a build script for building unit tests, which implies breaking the existing
build script up somewhat into:

check dependencies
configure
build
check/test
