create a node based processing library.

Initially focus on audio but without any dependence on any audio
specific libraries.

Requirements.

Graph structure must be read-only while processing. Meaning 
edges/connections cannot change while data is being processed by 
any of the vertices/nodes.

Graph processing must complete in a finite amount of time. i.e It is a 
directed acyclic graph.

processing a graph must be able to occur in parallel using more than
one thread but library must have as little knowledge of the thread model
as possible.

must have as little external dependencies as possible. Atomic primitives
should probably be provided by a separate library.
